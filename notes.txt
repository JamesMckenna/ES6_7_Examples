//Note: Converting a string to a native object is called deserialization, 
//while converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network is called serialization.
//parse(): Accepts a JSON string as a parameter, and returns the corresponding JavaScript object. deserialization
//stringify(): Accepts an object as a parameter, and returns the equivalent JSON string form. serialization
//in JSON only quoted strings may be used as properties.



//let myJSON = { "name": "Chris", "age": "38" }; <---this is Json data (serialized)
//myJSON logs => { name: "Chris", age: "38" } <---this is a javascript object (deserialized)
//let myString = JSON.stringify(myJSON);
//myString logs => "{"name":"Chris","age":"38"}"
